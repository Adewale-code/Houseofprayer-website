Located at "House 3, 4th Avenue, Peace estate,baruwa, Lagos state."<br><br> The church was still an open ground, it wasn't the modern type, we were still worshipping on  bare floor and we managed ourselves for another 4-5 years. The members started supporting, the first family in house of prayer were the Chukwu's family., joined us in 2011 and they're still members till date.<br>
    There were many storms and challenges but God has helped his church thus far, there was a time the shed we used for the church at the time fell on the ministers, But thank God it didn't lead to death, when it happened the church was challenged again and we had to start worshipping under the tree.
